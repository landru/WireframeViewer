Hello, my name is Andrew MacGinitie. This is my first github repository.

This WireframeViewer app started as sample code submitted for a potential contract, but it's actually at least the third
time I've written a similar application. The first time, I used Pascal; another version, written in Python, uses Pygame;
and this C# version is a Winforms application.
